# Random Python Test Game
 Just testing GitHub
 I made this game a year ago and I just uploaded it onto GitHub
 Works with Python 3, I have not tried with Python 2.

 # It's a work in progress
 It does not work, and if you try to play it it will annoy you
 
 # How to play
 ## Windows or Mac
 Download the latest version of python from python.org, then open the file, then press F5
 ## Linux
 Copy the path to the file and run this in the terminal
 `python3 <path to file without these brackets>`
